Bond duration is a weighted average maturity of bonds, based on its cash flows in present values.
The weight is computed as follows the denominator is the present value of bond (price), and the numerator is the cash flow discounted to present value.
To compute duration, for each coupon payment time, we compute the time times its weight, and summing all these terms.
