## Bond duration (Macaulay duration)
## Contents
Bond duration (**Macaulay duration**) is a weighted average maturity of bonds, based on its cash flows in present values.
The weight is computed as follows the denominator is the present value of bond (price), and the numerator is the cash flow discounted to present value.
To compute duration, for each coupon payment time, we compute the time times its weight, and summing all these terms.

Bond Duration (Macaulay) measures how it takes for the investors to be repaid a bonds price in Year. Therefore, it usually smaller than or equals to time to maturity
Duration is always between Y1 and YN, where Y1 is the year of the first payment and YN is the year of the last.
Zero coupon bond (discounted bond) has YN duration
