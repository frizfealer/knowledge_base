evaluation metric

1. Guard-rail-style metric is a good metric, because it does not provide a hard value, instead a guildline
2. Good metrics should be both high precision and recall. It means the metrics should capture the errors we want and not false alarms many times. To to measure the errors we want, human evaluators are needed to annotate the data.
