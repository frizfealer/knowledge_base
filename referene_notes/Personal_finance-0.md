Why you should invest?
1. Preserving Wealth against inflation: with inflation rate of 5% annually, purchasing power is halved every 14 years.
2. Replacing your human capital with financial capital, for your future self.
	1. Use discounted cash flow to estimate your total earning. Most personal injury lawyers utilize a discount rate of 1% to 3%. Use me as an example,  my salary 400k a year, assuming starting at age 37, retiring at 65, then the total earning is $400 + 400 * (1.02) + 400 * (1.02)^2  + \dots + 400 * (1.02)^{28}$
	2. Human capital diminishes each year; so we should build financial capital to replace human capital.
