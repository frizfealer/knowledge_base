# Naming in codes
## Contents
Do
1. The name should reveal your intention.
2. The name should show enough meaningful context; but don't add unneeded context
3. The name should be searchable. Use consistent spelling, e.g. similar prefix
4. Use pronounceable names for easy communication.
5. Use solution-domain-name (that is CS-background, because people read your code are programmers.), if not, use problem-domain-name
6. Class name should be noun phrase and method name should be verb phrase
7. Pick one word per concept, e.g. fetch, retrieve, should just use one word consistently.
Don't do
8. Avoid mis-information, like naming make people misunderstand. Avoid lower-case l and upper-case O.
9. Avoid to use noise word to make distinctions, e.g. Product vs ProductData
10. Avoid encoding in name. eg. don't put variable type in name, don't put member prefix in names (for instance variables), don't put interface prefix in names, instead put the imp prefix in names
11. Names should be straight-forward, don't use puns, jokes for names
