1.  Affect: the overall evaluation for the current situation, like positive or negative, safe or dangerous. This usually comes with the emotion in human being.
2. Cognitive: the system responsible for interpreting, understanding, and modeling of the world. It can also access memory evaluation. This is usually context-dependent and compared to affect.
3. Three levels model
	1. Reaction: the first layer and the primitive layer. This accepts the signals from sensory systems. It outputs affective signals and motor actions. It includes simple wired function to respond to the environment quickly.  
	2. Routine: the mid-level responsible for skilled and well-learned behaviors, like motor skills and language generation. This accepts the signals from the memory and from the sensory systems and affective signals. If the expectation outcome deviates from the memory, this triggers adjustments and learn. The affective signals change the behavior here. For example, if the affective signals are negative, the routine will be more prudent and more precise and focused.
	3. Relfection: This is the highest level that accepts inputs only from the lower levels. Affective signals also change the behavir at this level as routine level. This level is where system monitors its own operations.
